# CoderCreate: Your Code Teaching Assistant

## Overview
CoderCreate is an AI-powered code teaching assistant, created by **Agnish Paul**, designed to assist with coding-related queries. This assistant leverages advanced AI models to provide answers to various coding questions, explain programming concepts, and offer guidance on best practices for software development.

## Features
- **Expert Code Assistance**: Answers a wide range of coding questions, including debugging, code optimization, and best practices.
- **Programming Language Support**: Capable of assisting with multiple programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, etc.
- **Educational Guidance**: Helps explain complex programming concepts in a simplified manner, suitable for both beginners and advanced learners.
- **Code Generation**: Offers code examples and snippets tailored to specific needs.
- **Parameter Customization**: Provides a parameter to adjust response behavior for personalized learning.

## How CoderCreate Works
CoderCreate utilizes the following parameters for a customizable experience:
- **Temperature**: This parameter is set to `1`, ensuring a balance between creativity and accuracy in responses. A higher temperature leads to more creative and varied outputs, while a lower value provides more deterministic results.
- **System Instruction**: The assistant operates with a predefined system instruction:
  

## Getting Started
To start using CoderCreate, ensure that you have a compatible environment set up with the required dependencies. You can integrate CoderCreate into your project using the following setup:

### Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages can be installed using:

pip install openai langchain dotenv
Other dependencies include libraries for handling prompts, managing API interactions, and working with different programming languages.
Usage Instructions
Setup Environment Variables: Ensure you have the appropriate API keys and environment variables in a .env file:

OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=your_langchain_api_key
Initialize CoderCreate: You can initialize the assistant with a code snippet like the following:

python
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from openai import ChatCompletion

prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
    ("system", "You are a code teaching assistant named as codercreate created by Agnish Paul. Answer all code related questions."),
    ("user", "Please explain how to implement a binary search in Python.")
])

# Code to invoke and retrieve response
response = ChatCompletion.create(
    model="codegemma",
    prompt=prompt,
    temperature=1
)
print(response['choices'][0]['text'])
## Querying the Assistant: You can ask coding-related questions in natural language, and CoderCreate will respond with detailed answers or examples. For instance:

python

user_input = "How do I create a REST API in Flask?"

## Example Queries
Here are some example interactions with CoderCreate:

"What is the difference between a list and a tuple in Python?"
"Can you explain recursion with an example in JavaScript?"
"How do I implement a sorting algorithm using quicksort in C++?"
"What are some best practices for securing a web application in Django?"
